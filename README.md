# Hi there 👋

My name is Wyatt Howlett, and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Montreal with a passion for creating elegant, efficient, and user-friendly websites and applications.
I've been working as a With over five years of experience in the industry, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects for clients—from innovative startups to established corporations

In 2022, I founded my own business, Howltech Solutions, which has allowed me to take on more diverse and challenging work while collaborating directly with clients to bring their ideas to life.

I specialize in Full-Stack Web Development, and I’m always looking for new opportunities that push me to grow, learn, and refine my craft.
Whether I’m building scalable backend systems, designing intuitive user interfaces, or diving into new tech stacks, I’m driven by a love for problem-solving and continuous improvement.

Beyond technical skills, I believe being a great developer also means being thoughtful, communicative, and engaged—not just with the code, but with the people and world around me.
