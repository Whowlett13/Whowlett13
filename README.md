# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Wyatt Howlett**, a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Montreal with a passion for building elegant, efficient, and user-friendly websites and applications.

Over the past **five years**, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with a wide range of clientsâ€”from early-stage startups to large corporationsâ€”delivering solutions that are not only technically sound but also thoughtfully designed. My work blends front-end finesse with back-end strength, supported by a solid foundation in networking and systems architecture.

What drives me is the constant challenge to learn, grow, and create better experiencesâ€”both for users and the teams I collaborate with. I believe that great code is only part of the equation; great communication, empathy, and curiosity are just as essential.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or simply staying engaged with the world around me.
