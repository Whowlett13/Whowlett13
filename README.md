### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Whowlett13/Whowlett13** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Wyatt Howlett and I'm a FullStack Web Developer located in Montreal with a passion for creating elegant, efficient, and user-friendly websites and applications. I've been working as a developer for 1 year, and during that time, I've had the pleasure of working on a wide variety of projects for clients ranging from small startups to large corporations.
I specialize in Fullstack Web Development as well as Networking, and I'm always looking for new challenges that allow me to apply my skills and learn new things. I'm always striving to take on new projects that push me to grow and improve. In addition to my technical skills, I believe that a well-rounded developer is not only skilled in their craft, but also engaged with the world and the people around them.
